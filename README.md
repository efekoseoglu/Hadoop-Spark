#Hadoop- Spark

To run Spark codes on WIN10 21H2 LTSC, following environments required:

Pycharm,

HADOOP_HOME C:\Hadoop,

SPARK_HOME [C:\spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html),

JAVA_HOME [C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_202](https://www.oracle.com/tr/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)

I've added required Hadoop files under HADOOP_HOME in this repo. Links are directed to official spark and java pages.
